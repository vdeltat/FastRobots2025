#### Engineering Experience
- **Autonomous Systems Lab, Cornell University - Undergraduate Research Assistant**  
  Feb, 2024 - Present 
  - Adapted the EKF for relative motion object tracking algorithm for stereo camera object detection
  - Implemented an Extended Kalman Filter for object-tracking of an autonomous vehicle at a traffic intersection simulated with Jackal robots and using motion capture data for position
  - Expected Spring 2025: develop algorithm for path following and/or path planning for the same scenario

- **General Atomics Aeronautical Systems - Load and Dynamics Intern**  
  Jun, 2024 - Aug, 2024  
  - Reanalyzed the load and dynamics for the MQ-9A (remotely piloted aircraft) for a higher weight and different payload configurations, using NASTRAN, ZAERO, and internally developed MATLAB tools

- **Cornell Racing Project Team (FSAE Electric) - Mechanical Engineer**  
  Sept, 2021 - Feb, 2024  
  - Designed drivetrain mounting optimized for weight and strength through structural analysis and testing, motor and chain scatter shield design, general drivetrain and engine bay integration
  - Designed the riveted and welded sheet metal battery pack case for the electric racecar, integrating with internal electrical components and cooling, satisfying safety requirements and load cases, and halved fabrication time
  - Assisted with the mechanical layout and packaging of the internal electrical components of the battery pack
  - Designed parts for sheet metal bending, laser cutting, waterjetting, subtractive manufacturing, 3D printing
  - Presented design through multiple design reviews and documented design process, testing, and results in reports
  - Machined parts using the mill and lathe, and tig welded aluminum and steel parts

- **Creative Engineering - Mechanical Engineering Design Intern**  
  Jun, 2023 - Aug, 2023  
  - Designed models for 3D printing and rapid prototyping, as well as injection molding for early product development
  - Developed system of policy documents and secure computer to support Controlled Unclassified Information work
  - Designed elegant but manufacturable hand weight designs and sourced manufacturers
  - Wrote a product requirements document (PRD) and created prototype for a helmet load-offset system for a military contractor
 
- **Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory - Mechanical Engineering Design Intern**  
  Jun, 2022 - Aug, 2022  
  - Designed and built a large stand for a set of nulling coils, adjustable for two preset orientations, to cancel the Earth's magnetic field to test the magnetometer for the NOAA Space Weather Follow On program
  -	Designed a rigid fixturing structure for successful vibration and flight tests of a custom antenna array
  - Designed a tensile test setup and fixturing for different form factors of titanium alloy within a sealed forming gas environment to test hydrogen embrittlement, for the NASA Dragonfly mission: fly a rotorcraft on Saturn’s largest moon
  - Ordered COTS parts and submitted mechanical drawings for in-house manufacturing for each of the above projects as well as outsourced manufacturing

- **Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory - Mechanical Engineering Design Intern**  
  Jun, 2021 - Aug, 2021 
  - Created mechanical drawings for machined fittings, tubes, and sheet metal for the NASA ASTHROS high-altitude scientific balloon
  - Selected appropriate hardware and fasteners to structural assemblies

- **Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory - Biomechanics Intern**  
  Jun, 2019 - Aug, 2019 
  - Created an algorithm in MATLAB to automate finding the focus depth of a holographic image taken of rodent brains with a lensless camera using image analysis techniques, and then integrated it into a GUI

- **FIRST Robotics Competition Team 2537: Space RAIDers**  
  Jun, 2019 - Aug, 2019 
  - Mechanical Team Lead (4th year) – led mechanical team in developing a new training program during COVID
  -	Mechanical Sub-team Lead (3rd year) – led sub-team of five rookies in designing and building a cascading telescoping mechanism with a hook and winch system for the robot to lift itself on a bar during competition
  -	Mechanical Sub-team Lead (2nd year) – led a sub-team of four members in building a mechanical arm with a sprocket and chain system that performed consistently during every competition
  - Rookie Member (1st year) – helped design and build a reliable cascading elevator mechanism and winch system for the robot to lift itself on a bar during competition and continue to World Championships
