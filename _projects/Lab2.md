Lab1b writeup

Task 1: Hook the Artemis board up to your computer, and select the correct Board and Port in the ArduinoIDE. Typical connection issues include…

Task 2: In File->Examples->01.Basics, run Blink. (Note: you may need to slow the baud rate down for it to work.)

Task 3: In File->Examples->Apollo3, run Example4_Serial. (Note: to view the output and provide input open the serial monitor in the upper right hand corner of the script window, again check the baud rate.)

Task 4: In File->Examples->Apollo3, run Example2_analogRead to test your temperature sensor. Try blowing on or touching the chip to change its temperature. It may take a while to transfer your heat.

Task 5: In File->Examples->PDM, run Example1_MicrophoneOutput to test your microphone. E.g. try whistling or speaking to change the highest frequency.


Additional task 1: Program the board to blink an LED when you play a musical “C” note over the speaker, and off otherwise. Use your phone, computer, or similar to generate the sound. If you’re having fun you could even combine the microphone and the Serial output to generate an electronic tuner.
